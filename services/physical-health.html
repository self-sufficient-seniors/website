    <p class="">Studies show that exercise provides many health benefits and that seniors can gain a lot by staying physically active. Even moderate exercise and physical activity can improve the health of people who are frail or who have diseases that accompany aging.</p>
    <p class="">Being physically active can also help you stay strong and fit enough to keep doing the things you enjoy doing as you get older. Making exercise and physical activity a regular part of your life can improve your health and help you maintain your independence as you age.</p>
