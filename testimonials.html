        <p class="push-1-2"><strong>Self-Sufficient Seniors</strong> came <strong>highly recommended</strong> when we were looking for ways to increase my 84 year old mother’s physical activity and to provide her with more opportunities for cognitive stimulation. The sessions have been so successful that my 90 year old father requested that they work with him as well for back and hip pain and balance. The Four Factors of Independence approach is ideal for my parents as it is tailored to meet their individual needs.”</p>

        <p class="push-1-2">More than anything else, working with Self-Sufficient Seniors has brought us <strong>peace of mind</strong>. We live outside the area, we have worked remotely with them and we know for sure that our Aunt is being well cared for in every respect. The Self-Sufficient Seniors' staff really relates to people and has wonderful manners, excellent knowledge to solve many problems and this ensures <strong>successful treatments</strong> and <strong>happy patients</strong>.”</p>

        <p class="push-1-2">Generally, my father does not always respond positively to people that are there to help him. To the relief of my brother and me, he liked Karen (Self-Sufficient Seniors' founder) right from the start and continues to look forward to her visits. She has been the only person who has been able to get him to try walking which he can do a bit.”</p>
