          <p class="burgundy push-1-4">Founder</p>
          <p class="push-1-2">Karen graduated with honours from the University of Ottawa Human Kinetics undergraduate program and continued to pursue her passion at the University of New Brunswick where she received her Masters in Sports and Exercise Science. Her thesis focused on implementing physical health programs for vulnerable populations and measuring the physical and mental outcomes. This led her back into senior care upon returning to Ottawa. She continued her education and became a certified Cognitive Stimulation Therapist.</p>
          <p class="push-2">Since 2008, Karen has been working to upgrade the quality of life for seniors in the Ottawa area. Karen’s deep understanding of senior care needs and a passion for helping others lead her to establish Self-Sufficient Seniors in 2014. Since then, Karen has been providing innovative programs that are tailored specifically to the individual needs of her clients providing them with the independence seniors deserve.</p>
